URL Cleaner
-----------

Wtf is this ? It is a simple project I made for learning CMake.
So the project uses CMake for building, it is written in C and
most probably have no sense at all. Unless I find a reason to 
need to clean an URL.

So don't expect anything from those files. It is just a lot of noise.
